# 🔮 Future Dates Feature - Historical Climatology

**Version**: 1.2.0  
**Release Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

---

## 🎯 Overview

ClimaLens now supports selecting **any date from 1980 to 2100**, while maintaining its core principle: **historical likelihood analysis, not weather forecasting**.

### Key Concept

When you select a future date (e.g., July 15, 2030), ClimaLens:
- ✅ **Does**: Show historical patterns for "mid-July" across 45 years (1980-2025)
- ❌ **Does NOT**: Predict the specific weather on July 15, 2030

This is called **climatological analysis** – understanding typical conditions for a date-of-year, not forecasting a specific day.

---

## 📅 What Changed

### 1. Date Picker (Explore Page)

**Before** (v1.1):
- Date range: 1980-01-01 to 2025-09-01
- Future dates blocked

**After** (v1.2):
```typescript
// Date range: 1980-01-01 to 2100-12-31
minDate: new Date("1980-01-01")
maxDate: new Date("2100-12-31")  // NEW: Extended to 2100
```

**UI Changes**:
- Info icon (ⓘ) next to "Select Date" header
- Tooltip: *"We use historical climatology (1980–present). Future dates show historical likelihood, not a forecast."*
- Leap day indicator: Shows when Feb 29 is selected with handling explanation
- Year selector: Now includes all years 1980-2100 (121 years)

---

### 2. Day-Of-Year (DOY) Utilities

**New File**: `lib/doy.ts`

Core functions for date-to-DOY conversion and handling:

```typescript
// Get day-of-year (1-366)
getDOY(date: Date): number

// Handle leap day normalization for historical lookup
normalizeLeapDOY(doy: number, isLeap: boolean): number

// Generate ±N day window with year-boundary wrapping
wrapWindow(centerDOY: number, windowSize: number, maxDOY: number): number[]

// Check if date is in the future
isFutureDate(date: Date): boolean

// Check if date is Feb 29
isLeapDay(date: Date): boolean
```

#### Leap Day Handling Policy

**Problem**: Feb 29 (DOY 60) only exists in leap years. How to handle historical lookup?

**Solution**: Conservative normalization
```
Feb 29 (DOY 60) → Map to Feb 28 (DOY 59) for historical data
After Feb 29 → Shift DOY back by 1 to align with non-leap years
```

**Example**:
```
User selects: Feb 29, 2024 (leap year)
       ↓
DOY = 60 → normalized to 59 (Feb 28)
       ↓
Query: All Feb 28 periods (±7 days) across 1980-2025
       ↓
Result: Historical patterns around Feb 28/Mar 1
```

**Window Effect**: The ±7 day window naturally includes both Feb 28 and Mar 1 data, effectively averaging around the leap day.

---

### 3. Results Page Disclaimer

**New UI Elements**:

#### A. "Historical" Badge
- Shows next to the date when future date is analyzed
- Located in Query Summary card
- Badge text: "Historical"
- Color: `variant="secondary"`

#### B. Dismissible Alert
- Appears below Query Summary when future date detected
- Color: Blue theme (`border-blue-200`, `bg-blue-50`)
- Icon: Info (ⓘ)
- Dismissible: X button in top-right

**Alert Content**:
```
Title: "Historical likelihood only — not a forecast"

Body: "These results reflect historical patterns for this date-of-year 
       across 1980–present. [Learn more]"
```

#### C. "Learn More" Dialog

Clicking "Learn more" opens a modal explaining:

**Title**: Historical Climatology vs Weather Forecast

**Content**:
1. **What ClimaLens does**: Uses long-term historical data to estimate likelihood, not predict future weather
2. **What you're seeing**: 45 years of NASA data showing how often extreme conditions occurred around this date
3. **What this is NOT**: A weather forecast (only reliable 1-10 days ahead)
4. **Recommendation**: Combine with short-range forecasts for day-specific planning

### Backend Changes

**None required!** The analysis API already operates on day-of-year basis. No modifications needed to:
- `/api/analyze-weather` route
- Google Earth Engine queries
- Probability calculations
- Percentile logic

### URL & Share Links

**Query Parameters** (unchanged):
```
/dashboard/explore?lat=10.8231&lon=106.6297&date=2050-08-10&location=Ho+Chi+Minh+City
```

**Behavior**:
- Future dates preserved in URL
- On page load, `isFutureDate()` checks date
- If future → show disclaimer automatically
- Share link works identically for past/future dates

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests

**File**: `lib/__tests__/doy.test.ts`

**Coverage**:
```typescript
✅ isLeapYear() - Identifies 2000, 2004, 2024 as leap; 2100, 2023 as non-leap
✅ getDOY() - Returns correct DOY for Jan 1, Feb 29, Dec 31
✅ normalizeLeapDOY() - Maps Feb 29 → Feb 28, shifts post-leap DOYs
✅ wrapWindow() - Handles year boundaries (DOY 1 ±7 → [359...365, 1...7])
✅ isFutureDate() - Compares dates relative to today
✅ isLeapDay() - Detects Feb 29
✅ dateFromDOY() - Reverse conversion (DOY → Date)
```

**Run Tests**:
```bash
npm test lib/__tests__/doy.test.ts
```

## 📊 Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Leap Day (Feb 29)

**Scenario**: User selects Feb 29 in any leap year

**Handling**:
- Tooltip appears: *"Leap-day handling: mapped to historical distribution around Feb 28/Mar 1."*
- DOY 60 normalized to 59 for historical lookup
- ±7 day window includes both Feb 28 and Mar 1 data
- Results represent typical late-February conditions

**Example**:
```
Select: Feb 29, 2028
DOY: 60 → Normalized: 59
Window: DOY 52-66 (Feb 21 - Mar 7)
Result: Probability based on 45 years of late-Feb/early-Mar data
```

### 2. Year Boundaries

**Scenario**: DOY near start/end of year with ±7 window

**Handling**:
- `wrapWindow()` wraps around year boundaries
- DOY 1 (Jan 1) ±7 → [359, 360, ..., 365, 1, 2, ..., 7]
- DOY 365 (Dec 31) ±7 → [358, ..., 365, 1, 2, ..., 6]

**Example**:
```
Select: Jan 3, 2099
DOY: 3
Window: DOY 360-366 (prev year) + 1-10 (current year)
Result: Spans New Year's period across all 45 years
```

### 3. Very Distant Futures

**Scenario**: User selects Dec 31, 2100 (far future)

**Handling**:
- Analysis proceeds normally (maps to DOY 365)
- Disclaimer shows prominently
- Results remain valid (historical patterns)
- No special "warning" beyond standard disclaimer

**Rationale**: Even 75 years in the future, the question "What are historical late-December patterns here?" is scientifically valid.

### 4. Time Zones

**Handling**:
- DOY computed using local browser time
- Time-of-day ignored (normalized to midnight)
- Only date matters, not hour/minute
- Consistent across all time zones

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Decisions

### Why Info Icon (not Warning)?

- **Info** (ⓘ): Neutral, educational
- **Not Warning** (⚠️): Would imply something is wrong
- **Rationale**: Future dates are a valid use case, not an error

### Why Dismissible Alert?

- **First-time users**: Need clear explanation
- **Repeat users**: Can dismiss after reading once
- **Not permanent**: Respects user's understanding

### Why Blue (not Red/Yellow)?

- **Blue**: Informational, calm
- **Not Red**: Would suggest error/danger
- **Not Yellow**: Would suggest caution/warning
- **Rationale**: This is information, not a problem

### Badge Placement

- **Next to date**: Immediately visible
- **"Historical" text**: Clear, concise
- **Secondary variant**: Subtle, not alarming

   - Unit tests for all DOY functions

---

## 🔍 Scientific Rationale

### Why Allow Future Dates?

**Use Case**: Event planners, agriculturalists, travelers want to know:
> *"What are typical weather patterns for this location at this time of year?"*

**Example Questions**:
- "I'm getting married in Bali on June 15, 2026. How often is it rainy in mid-June?"
- "Planning a construction project in Phoenix for August 2027. How hot does it typically get?"
- "Should I book a ski trip to Aspen for Feb 2028? How reliable is snow coverage?"

**Answer**: Historical climatology provides this context.

### Climatology vs Forecasting

| Aspect | Climatology (ClimaLens) | Weather Forecast |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Time Scale** | Long-term (45 years) | Short-term (1-10 days) |
| **Question** | "How often does X happen?" | "Will X happen on Tuesday?" |
| **Data** | Historical patterns | Real-time models + observations |
| **Accuracy** | High for probabilities | Decreases beyond 7 days |
| **Use** | Planning, research | Day-to-day decisions |

**Both are valuable**, but for different purposes.

### IPCC & WMO Alignment

This approach aligns with:
- **IPCC AR6**: Use of historical baselines for climate assessment
- **WMO Guidelines**: Climatological normals (30+ year averages)
- **ETCCDI**: Climate extremes indices (percentile-based)

**ClimaLens is doing established climate science**, not experimental forecasting.
